# Tycoon 

- Idk what to call it. generic business growth theme atm. I'll think of a better theme later.
- use ````git clone git@github.com:NaokiTM/tycoon.git```` to clone
- Then run ````npm install```` in the projects root directory to install dependencies
- Run ````npm run dev```` and visit the localhost address specified in the terminal to view the app running.
